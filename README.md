# Cloud Optimized Distributed Earth Data (CODED)
A Funding Friday project from the ESIP 2025 Summer Meeting.

## Goal
This project seek to determine the best approach and performance for backing cloud-optimized libraries like Zarr with distributed storage systems like IPFS.  

## Approach
* Review prior art
* Develop best practices, enhancements and packages as needed
* Construct real-world test cases
* Compare performance of distributed storage like IPFS with traditional object storage

## Infrastructure
* Deploy nodes in several different regions using [Pulumi](pulumi.md) IaC.
